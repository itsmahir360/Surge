           <p style="text-align: left;" id="About_Surge_text"> Surge is not just another robot—he's "The Upgrade." A sleek, self-modifying combat machine from Starr Park's experimental Protocol 4 program, Surge was designed by the brilliant mechanic Max to adapt and overcome any challenge on the battlefield. His personality is as flashy as his glowing core: cocky, confident, and always ready to show off his latest evolution. If you're looking for a brawler whose power escalates from zero to hero within a single match, Surge is your choice.

               <ul>
                  <li>Stage 1 – Movement Speed: After the first Super, Surge runs faster, making it easier to dodge shots and chase enemies..
                 </li>
                 <li>Stage 2 – Attack Range: After the second Super, Surge’s main attack (the energy blast) gets a longer range, allowing him to hit enemies from farther away. </li>
                 <li>Stage 3 – Attack Splits: After the third Super, Surge’s attack splits into 6 smaller projectiles upon hitting an enemy or reaching max range, increasing his damage spread and area control.</li>
