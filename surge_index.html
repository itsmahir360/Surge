           <p style="text-align: left;" id="About_Surge_text"> Surge is not just another robotâ€”he's "The Upgrade." A sleek, self-modifying combat machine from Starr Park's experimental Protocol 4 program, Surge was designed by the brilliant mechanic Max to adapt and overcome any challenge on the battlefield. His personality is as flashy as his glowing core: cocky, confident, and always ready to show off his latest evolution. If you're looking for a brawler whose power escalates from zero to hero within a single match, Surge is your choice.
