         <h2>About Surge</h2>
         <p>Surge is not just another robotâ€”he's "The Upgrade." A sleek, self-modifying combat machine from Starr Park's experimental Protocol 4 program, Surge was designed by the brilliant mechanic Max to adapt and overcome any challenge on the battlefield. His personality is as flashy as his glowing core: cocky, confident, and always ready to show off his latest evolution. If you're looking for a brawler whose power escalates from zero to hero within a single match, Surge is your choice.</p>

              <li>Main Attack - Power Surge: Fires a long-range energy blast that splits upon impact, making him lethal around walls.</li>
               <li>Super - Self-Upgrade!: The core of his gameplay. Using his Super permanently evolves him to a new stage, enhancing his   abilities.</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Stage 1 Upgrade: His main attack splits into three projectiles instead of two for superior area control.
                 </li>
                 <li>Stage 2 Upgrade: Replaces his Super with Serve Ice Cold, a quick teleport for dodging, engaging, and jumping over walls.</li>
                 <li>Stage 3 Upgrade: His main attack projectiles now ricochet to additional targets, allowing him to dominate grouped enemies.</li>
